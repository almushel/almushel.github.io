		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>JavaScript Gameplay Programming</p>
		<h3>What I did</h3>
		<p>
			For this project, I decided to focus primarily on learning about path-finding and graph traversal algorithms.
			Since I had never done that before, I went through a few different resources to familiarise myself
			algorithms like breadth-first search, Dijkstra's, and A*, adapting them to use map format similar to what the 
			game itself used (a one dimensional array of integers).
		</p>
		<p>
			Once I had that working, I immediately encountered a problem integrating it with the game: 
			Ghost Rustlers is a side-scrolling game, so character path-finding is limited by gravity as well as tile value.
			This was another novel problem (from my perspective) for me to solve.
		</p>
		<p>
			After some research, which, I eventually realized that this was not an algorithm problem; it was a data structure problem.
			Understanding that, I wrote a simple function to generate path-finding graphs from the level data,
			given a relatively simple set of rules defining legal nodes and connections.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since I was also working on character movement and simple enemy behavior at the same time, I was able to add these rules 
			as I added new movement functionality (e.g. hopping up one tile ledges, jumping over 1 tile gaps, and climbing ladders).
		</p>
