# Technical Writing

## inertHTML Readme

inertHTML is a command-line static site generator I wrote in Go.
It generates template-based static html pages from `.md` source files.
This page and the rest of the website was generated from markdown files using this utility.

The readme has been written as the tool was developed. It describes
standard usage and the features of its markdown implementation.

## Quickstart & Integration Guides

A major focus of my work at Unstoppable Domains was providing a single entry point
for partners looking to use the single sign-on product in their applications.
This getting started page guided new partners through every step needed to
acquire their API credentials and integrate UAuth.

The contents and information architecture of these pages evolved substantially over time,
in response to the evolving needs of the product and qualitative data gathered in
ongoing internal usability testing.

## Library Reference Pages

The public interfaces of Unstoppable Login were not always rigorously defined,
and there was no process for generating reference documentation from code.

I initiated and drove to completion a project to fully document every one
of the core and middleware libraries that we supported.

## Release Notes

Because no standardized procedure existed at the company level for generating and publishing product changelogs,
I worked with the product manager on the team to promote
noteworthy new features of the Login dashboards, libraries, and APIs as they became public.

## Standard Operating Procedures

SOPs were written and adapted to a standardized format from a range of materials,
including older SOPs, manuals, and the oral tradition (speaking to lab managers).
Once the content was complete, it was converted to the FlippingBook format
and uploaded to the in-house learning management system.

## Multimedia Training Modules

Certain SOPs would be identified for more substantial training coverage. 
Students and researchers would be required to complete this training before
they were granted access to the relevant equipment in the lab.

I would adapt SOPs into larger multimedia training modules as follows:

1. Write a script detailing contents and narration for each slide of the presentation.
2. Create a shot list detailing the individual shots (angles, close-ups, etc) needed for each video demonstration.
3. Take pictures of the machine, controls, components, etc.
4. Direct, shoot, and edit video demonstrations.
5. Perform, record, and edit audio narration.
6. Compile completed assets into an Adobe Captivate presentation.

This presentation was then added to the in-house learning management system,
along with a quiz users were required to pass in order to complete the training.
